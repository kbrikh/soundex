<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A package that provide a module to genarate the SOUNDEX tag. 

This package is configured for french laguage. However, it can be used for any language. To do so, you should replace the code-fr.json
with the one corresponding to your need.

This file include the corresponding code, the unused and the special characters to take into account for genrating the SOUNDEX tag.

For more information bout the Soundex algorithm and usage, thanks to wkipedia :

> Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.
>
> The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. 
>
> Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Ingres, MS SQL Server and Oracle.) 
>
> Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project has no dependencies in production mode.

The only thing you have to do after downloading the source code :

```sh
npm install
```

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```javascript
const soundex = require('<soundex path to index file>');

// Will provide a tag with one character and 4 digit (default behavior)
let tag = soundex('Chouchene');

// Provide a tag with one character and 3 digits
let idx = soundex('Chouchene', 3);

```


## Running the tests

All tests are configured and use Jasmine framework to be deployed.

```sh
npm test
```

### And coding style tests

For linting we use **eslint** with airbnb ruleswith some tweeks.

```sh
npm run lint
```
